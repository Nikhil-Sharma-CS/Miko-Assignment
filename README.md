Hi! This is a Project for Miko company.

This is a Project for executing simple assembly language commands which include ADD, SHOW, MV.

It uses Redis datastructure store to store the data values as key pairs.




## ðŸš€ About Me
*Hi, My name is Nikhil Sharma*,

I'm a full stack developer apprentice at Geekster. I have knowledge of Java, OOPs, Maven, APIs, DSA, SpringBoot, MySQL.


## MV

- This command is used to enter a new register with its value.

- Syntax for this command is 

        MV REG1,#2000

## SHOW

- This command is used to show the register's  value.

- Syntax for this command is 

        SHOW REG1

## ADD

- This command is used to add a value to the register.
- Here you can either add a numeric value to a register or you can add value of another register to it.

- Syntax for this command is 

        ADD REG1,REG3
            
          --  OR --
        
        ADD REG1,400


## DELETE

- This command is used to delete a key from the database.

- Syntax for this command is

        DELETE RegisterName
## Guide

- Now this program contains a single api that takes the string input and will generate the output accordingly.

- Make sure to insert the valid commands as mentioned above or else it will show an error.

- Both SpringBoot and Redis are used as docker containers here.
## Summary

*In summary, this application helps us to understand how we can use docker containers to containerize the application and gives us the basic idea of how the assembly program works.*
